# Vibe Coding Chat History

> (Command Pallete) **Chat: Configure Instructions**

- Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.`github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

- Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:

- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns
Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.`github/copilot-instructions.md`,`AGENT.md`,`AGENTS.md`,`CLAUDE.md`,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,`README.md`}` (do one glob search).

- Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):

- If .`github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns
Update .`github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.

- Searched for files matching `**/{.`github/copilot-instructions.md`,`AGENT.md`,`AGENTS.md`,`CLAUDE.md`,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,`README.md`}`, no matches

- Created `copilot-instructions.md`

- `copilot-instructions.md` has been created with actionable, project-specific guidelines for AI coding agents. It references `onboarding.md` and covers architecture, workflows, conventions, integration points, and examples tailored to Cakeaway.

Please review the instructions and let me know if any section is unclear or missing details, so I can further refine it for your team.

길
I'll analyze the requirements document and create comprehensive overview and onboarding documents for the Cakeaway project. Let me start by examining the current structure and then create these essential documentation files.

- Read `cakeaway`
- Read `docs`

Now I'll create the comprehensive overview and onboarding documents based on the requirements analysis.

- Created `overview.md`
- Created `onboarding.md`

I've successfully created two comprehensive documentation files for the Cakeaway project:

I'll update the copilot-instructions.md file to reference the new documentation and include key constraints and decisions directly in the file.

copilot-instructions.md+99-19

I've successfully updated the copilot-instructions.md file to provide comprehensive context for AI coding agents working on the Cakeaway project. Here are the key improvements:

### 🔧 Key Changes Made

1. Enhanced Project Context
   - Added detailed project overview explaining the cake factory simulation concept
   - Included clear architecture diagram showing the monorepo structure
   - Provided specific technology stack versions (2025.07 baseline)
2. Critical Design Decisions
   - Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between UI and business logic packages
   - Technology Stack: Explicit version requirements and rationale
   - Development Philosophy: Vibe Coding principles and AI-first approach
3. Important Constraints
   - DO NOT READ logs/ directory: Explicit instruction to avoid log files
   - TypeScript v5 strict mode: No any types allowed
   - Monorepo structure: Never mix concerns between packages
   - Vibe Coding principles: Use descriptive prompts for complex logic
4. Core Game Systems
   - Grid System, Production System, Logistics System
   - EIN/ECN Process, Market System
   - Clear understanding of game mechanics for AI agents
5. Development Workflows
   - References to detailed documentation (onboarding.md, overview.md)
   - Common patterns for state management, error handling, performance
   - Testing strategies and guidelines
6. AI Coding Guidelines
   - Effective prompting strategies
   - Code generation best practices
   - When to consult specific documentation

### 🎯 Benefits

1. Immediate Context: AI agents get essential information without reading full docs
2. Clear Constraints: Prevents common mistakes and enforces architectural decisions
3. Proper References: Directs to appropriate documentation for detailed guidance
4. Vibe Coding Optimized: Structured for AI-driven development workflows

This updated file now serves as a comprehensive quick-reference for AI coding agents while directing them to the detailed documentation for specific implementation guidance.
